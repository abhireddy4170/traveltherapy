"So, one of the projects I've worked on is a simple webpage I called 'TravelTherapy.' The main idea behind it was to explore how travel can actually be therapeutic. I included content discussing this concept and also shared some of my own personal experiences with travel and how it's helped me. On this project, my role was pretty hands-on â€“ I was both the designer and the coder. For the technical side, I kept it straightforward, using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and a bit of JavaScript for any interactive elements. It was a great way to put my basic web development skills into practice and create something that also reflected a personal interest."
