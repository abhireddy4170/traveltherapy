<h1 STYLE="font-size:50PX;text-align:center;">TRAVELLING IS A THERAPY.</h1>
<p style="font-size:30PX; text-align:center; line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 50px;">Hello everyone  welocome to my travel world. i created this page to let you guys know how travel benifits us.I travelled to some of the places like vijayawada,vishakapatanam,araku. mostly i prefer bike but some situations made us to travel by train. Traveling can improve your mental health by: Helping you feel calm. Taking time from work to see new places releases the stress you've been holding onto. Relieving the tension and stress of your work life lets your mind relax and heal.</p>

<p style="font-size:30PX; text-align:center; line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 50px;">The more people we meet from every walk of life, the more we learn how to communicate better with each other. Travel isnâ€™t always an uneventful experience and at times we have to show great tolerance towards each other! We tend to go out of our way more when we travel, to communicate with people.</p>

<h1 STYLE="font-size:35PX;text-align:center;"> ARAKU </h1>
<p style="font-size:30PX; text-align:center; line-height: 30px;">Araku is famous for its coffee plantations surrounded by beautiful gardens, streams, waterfalls and valleys that are covered with lush green forests. Situated in the Eastern Ghats, the hill station is about 112 km southeast of Vishakhapatnam.</P>

<h1 STYLE="font-size:25PX;">PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:</h1>

<p style="font-size:30PX; text-align:center; line-height: 30px;"> As i told it in beginning we travelled by train so unexpected incident happened to us i.e we are covering araku places like borra caves,valleys,coffee plantations,etc by bus itself because we didn't get the bike/car rentals in araku so at the last only one place left i.e katika waterfalls it's the heighest waterfall in araku , their is no public transportation to go there ,No one is helping out to reach there,and sky is getting dark and we getting late but we fixed to cover it anyway, a lorry helped us to reach there everything gone well , enjoyed there had  a 15 min of trek & relaxed for 20 min approx. The Twist  started here that how to go back hotel? some tourists came by their own vehicles, we asked everyone but all are full pack in their vehicles, my friends are getting nervous and fear because it's a remote controlled area ,mobile singals are not working ,and they said that while coming they've seen that those tribal people a group 4 or 5 sitting in a field & doing something overthere like blackmagic and all. it's to risky place to stay there but by god's grace one software gang helped out to vacate from there, actually the coincidence is they are also from hyderabad. see wherever you go your native people helps you out in any situation . that's the sweet and sour memories we had in araku . yes it's only about araku , every trip has some incidents like these because people like us and you are adventurous.
